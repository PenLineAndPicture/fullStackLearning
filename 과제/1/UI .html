        <div class="second_dspt dspt1">
            A year after a series of incidents, the horsemen have a magic show to expose the plot of the smartphone maker 'Octa'.
            However, after being attacked by a magic show by an unknown character, Dylan and Horseman were scattered.
        </div>
        <div class="second_dspt dspt2">
            The identity of the person who raided the magic show was Walter, the major shareholder of Tresler Insurance Company. Four Horseman, who was offered to take the chip from Walter, was forced to accept it by Atlas' arbitrary actions.
        </div>

        <div class="second_dspt dspt3">
            Meanwhile, Dylan, who was being pursued by the FBI, helped Thaddeus by accepting an offer to help if he could escape him.
            On the way to Macau, Thaddeus deliberately provokes, revealing his past. However, after hearing Dylan's words that it doesn't matter, he disappears, leaving behind a note saying 'Next is your turn' and a memento from Dylan's father.
        </div>

        <div class="second_dspt dspt4">
            Four Horseman succeeds in seizing Chip, arrives at the bargaining point with Walter, and finally meets Dylan again. But betrayed by Wilter, Four Horseman is on the run again, and Dylan is on the verge of death.
        </div>
        <div class="second_dspt dspt5">
            However, Walter's chip was a fake, and with the help of 'The Eye', Four Horsemen was able to get together again. They are struck by Walter and they organize a great magic show to uncover the conspiracy.
